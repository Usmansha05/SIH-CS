# SIH-CS
AI-powered smart classroom and timetable scheduler that generates optimized, clash-free schedules for colleges using Firebase and Gemini Genkit. Supports AI-based suggestions, natural language queries, realtime updates, approvals, and PDF/Excel exports for efficient academic management.

Detailed README Description:
This project is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to automate and optimize timetable creation for higher education institutions. The system addresses common challenges in manual scheduling such as overlapping classes, underutilized classrooms, uneven faculty workload, and student dissatisfaction.

Key features of the platform include automated timetable generation that considers faculty availability, classroom capacity, subject hours, and departmental constraints. The system provides AI-driven suggestions for rearrangements in case of conflicts or overloads, ensuring an optimal timetable solution. Users can perform natural language queries to find free classrooms, labs, or faculty schedules in real-time.

The platform includes an administrative dashboard for managing faculties, classrooms, and subjects, with all data stored in Firebase Firestore. Timetables can be previewed in a color-coded grid for clarity, approved by authorized personnel, and exported as PDF or Excel files. The system is deployed on Firebase Hosting with realtime updates, making it fully accessible and ready for demo purposes.

This project demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence into education management systems, offering a scalable, adaptive, and enterprise-ready solution for academic institutions. It highlights innovation in smart education, efficient resource utilization, and enhanced decision-making for administrators, faculty, and students alike.
